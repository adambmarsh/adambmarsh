### Projects I'm busy with...

#### [OSS Review Toolkit](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort)

OSS Review Toolkit (ORT) provides tooling to safely use, integrate, modify and redistribute third party software including [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). 

You can use it to:
- Generate [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org) or [SPDX](https://spdx.dev) SBOMs for your software project
- Automate your FOSS policy using _Policy as Code_ to do licensing, security vulnerabilities and engineering standards checks for your software project and its dependencies
- Correct found invalid or missing package metadata (licensing, source location, etc.)
- Overwrite scanner license findings in the sources of your software project and its dependencies
- Mark files, directories or or package manager scopes as not included in your software project or dependency released artifacts - use it to make clear that license findings in build scripts, documentation or tests in a package sources do not apply to the release (binary) artifact
- Create a source code archive for your software project, including its dependencies to comply with certain licenses or have your own copy as nothing on the internet is forever

I regularly contribute to the ORT documentation to help its users better understand how they can use tool to review their software projects

#### [music_base](https://github.com/adambmarsh/music_base)

Music Base (music_base) is an experiment to build a solution that makes it easier to
search through a music collection and automatically create playlists. 

The driver behind is project was frustration with the limitations of the search
functionality in VLC and on my NAS (QNAP) and Kodi.
